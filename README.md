## Virtualisation Software
In this project, I downloaded  an [Oracle virtual box](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/7.0.6/VirtualBox-7.0.6-155176-Win.exe, "Download Cirtual Box Here") for my virtualitaion environment.Since I am using a windows 10 as host, I downloaded the windows Virtual Box

## Guest Operating System
In this project, I made use of [Cent OS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/osboxes/files/v/vb/10-C-nt/9/Workstation/64bit.7z/download, "Download CentOS") as the guest Operating System downloaded from [oxboxes.org](https://www.osboxes.org/,"osboxes") which has several pre-installed and pre-configured linux distros
